# empoWered_in_Tech
## Overview
EmpoWered in Tech is a platform where Wellesley CS (& DS, MAS) students & affiliates can share opportunities -- such as industry internships, REUs, other research programs, hackathons, conferences, workshops, etc. -- that they come across online and think others might be interested in.
Wellesley students are often in two varying stressful situations: they either get inundated with opportunities from various sources (Google groups, Facebook, word of mouth), which can be overwhelming and doesn’t help the user be organized/have everything in a same location, or they can be daunted by the prospect of scouring the internet to find opportunities, even though there are multiple places online to search for opportunities. Our web-based application stands as an approachable starting point for people looking for opportunities.
We know how valuable it is to hear about other people in our community's experiences and opinions working at a company or attending an event, so we implemented a comment section that allow users to share personal insight on their past experiences with each opportunity.

## Design
Our application is meant for the Wellesley community, which means only people with a Wellesley email can create an account and have access to the website. Once you’ve signed up and logged-in, you’ll have several ways to interact with it:

You can access the main page of our design, which displays a feed of opportunities. In this page, you can scroll through opportunity postings, read comments, search by specific keywords, filter the displayed postings, and click on an opportunity to see more details about a post and write comments.

You can also create your own opportunities to add to the database. You’ll be redirected to a form where you supply some information like name, company, location, and type of opportunity. There are also optional fields like adding a description or referral link. Once you submit the opportunity, you’re redirected to its respective post page. If you find that you made a mistake or want to update information, users can update or delete their own posts. Just find it via search in the main feed page.

Lastly, you can access your profile page and update that as well.

As of right now, you can’t see other users profiles or interact with users other than through the comment sections of opportunities. This is because our application is first and foremost an opportunities database, but potential advancements we may make would be like linking each username to its respective profile, or implementing a search feature for users as well as opportunities.
